Steps to solve:
1. loop through wordlist to get the current word - done
2. loop through the grid rows and columns with nested loop to get letter positions - done
3. compare currentChar to first letter of word to see if it matches. - done
    - if character matches check the other surrounding characters for match of second letter
    - repeat above for length of word until no match is found
4. if word is found push it to new array of results - done
5. return results after done looping through wordlist - done

I was able to get to the first part of step 3 on my own but got stonewalled and spent some time scouring the internet for help. After looking into it and a lot of thinking I was able to 
find this solution. This was a very challenging toy problem and helped me to understand 2D arrays much better than I did before. Thank you for the opportunity.
